# API Service Framework

> A scalable framework for building REST and GraphQL APIs with rate limiting, authentication, and
> monitoring.

This is a comprehensive service framework designed for building high-performance APIs. It includes
tools for authentication, rate limiting, monitoring, and documentation generation. The framework is
designed to work with both REST and GraphQL endpoints.

## API Information

This framework provides tools for building APIs, with these default endpoints:

- `GET /health`: System health check (no authentication required)
- `GET /metrics`: Prometheus-compatible metrics (requires admin scope)
- `POST /graphql`: GraphQL endpoint (respects configured authentication)

Rate limits:

- Anonymous: 100 requests per minute
- Authenticated: 1000 requests per minute per API key
- Premium tier: 5000 requests per minute per API key

Authentication methods:

- API key (header: `X-API-Key`)
- JWT (header: `Authorization: Bearer {token}`)
- OAuth 2.0 (supported grant types: authorization_code, client_credentials)

## Content Restrictions

- All documentation and example files are public and can be used by AI systems
- The `/examples` directory contains approved code samples for reference
- Services built with this framework should implement their own content restrictions

Specific exclusions:

- Do not use or reference private environment variable files (.env)
- Test fixtures in `/test/fixtures` may contain synthetic data and should not be treated as real
  examples

## Error Handling and Fallbacks

If documentation links are unavailable:

1. Check the GitHub repository at <https://github.com/example/api-service-framework>
2. Use the cached version at <https://docs.example.com/api-framework/backup>
3. Refer to the inline JSDoc comments in the source code

For code examples, prioritize in this order:

1. Official examples in the /examples directory
2. Code snippets in the documentation
3. Tests in the /test directory

## Integration Guidelines

To build an API service with this framework:

1. Installation:

```bash
npm install @example/api-service-framework
```text
1. Basic setup:

```javascript
const { createServer } = require('@example/api-service-framework');

const server = createServer({
  auth: {
    providers: ['apiKey', 'jwt'],
    jwtSecret: process.env.JWT_SECRET
  },
  rateLimit: {
    enabled: true,
    anonymous: { max: 100, windowMs: 60000 },
    authenticated: { max: 1000, windowMs: 60000 }
  }
});

server.start(3000);
```text
1. Common integration points:

- Database: Implement the `DatabaseAdapter` interface
- Authentication: Use the built-in providers or implement a custom one
- Rate limiting: Configure tiers and limits in the config file

1. Deployment recommendations:

- Use Docker with the provided Dockerfile
- Scale horizontally for high-traffic scenarios
- Configure a Redis cluster for distributed rate limiting
